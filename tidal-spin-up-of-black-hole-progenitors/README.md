# Modelling the spin up for black hole progenitors in binary star systems

The most massive stars, O type and B type stars, can form black holes at the end of their life. In addition, these stars are typically found in binary, or higher order triple systems.

For binaries with sufficiently short orbital separations (corresponding to orbital periods are shorter than ~ days), their remnant black hole binary can merge due to the emission of gravitational waves on a timescale shorter than the age of the universe (ignoring additional possibilities such as birth kicks etc.).

These merger events are being detected by the LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA network since 2015. Perhaps the most remarkable event to date is [GW231123](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02212-7). Einstein's theory of General Relativity only permits black holes to spin below a maximum rotation rate. Somehow, GW231123's constituents were spinning close to their respective limits before the merger.

Other events have also been suggested to spin mildly. But the origin of spins is hotly debated. 

The formation of black holes, and their final spin and mass is a multi-dimensional process that requires extremely computationally expensive simulations. 

Ignoring angular momentum at the birth of a black hole, we can consider spin up in the progenitor stars of black holes in binaries from tidal interactions.
